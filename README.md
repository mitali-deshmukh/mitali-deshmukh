### Hi, I’m Mitali!

I’m a software engineer with 3+ years of experience building reliable, user focused systems. I work across frontend and backend and I care deeply about clarity, correctness, and scale.

### What I do well
• Build production systems used by real users, including platforms serving 50 plus financial institutions
• Design clean APIs and data flows using Python, Node.js, FastAPI, and GraphQL
• Ship frontend features with React, TypeScript, and modern web tooling
• Think in systems, event driven flows, concurrency, caching, and failure handling
• Turn vague problem statements into working, measurable solutions
